1. What is Boolean? Write down 3 different expression that results a Boolean type
 
*A Boolean value is either true or falsee. It is named after the British mathematician, George
Boole, who first formulated Boolean algebra — some rules for reasoning about and combining
these values. This is the basis of all modern computer logic.
*Example:  >>>15==(6+9)
           True
           >>> 15==69
	   False
	   >>> n = 9
	   >>> n + 6 ==15
	   True


3. What is nested conditionals? Write a piece of code that uses nested conditionals

* . Conditional statements give us the ability to check conditions and
change the behavior of the program accordingly.

* Example:
Name = input("Say my name")
if Name == "Heisenberg":
   print("Walter White")
else:
   print("Pinkman")
